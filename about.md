I’m currently a Ph.D. student in Robotics at Oregon State University. I am a graduate research assistant at Manufacturing Process Control Laboratory. I completed my Master’s degree at OSU in Summer 2025, where my research focused on modeling and control of vibrations in machining processes. I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Tehran, where my work centered on the design and precision control of voice-coil actuators.
